//
//  What has to be opened to answer a field — which is the whole performance
//  story of this package.
//
//  Measured on a tree of 107,765 files: reading name, size, dates and type for
//  every one of them takes 3.9 s, because those come from the directory the
//  kernel already walked. Asking Spotlight for the same files takes 54.8 s.
//  Opening each image to read its EXIF costs about 0.32 ms per file, and
//  hashing costs whatever the disk costs.
//
//  So a reader that always reads everything is 14× slower than one that reads
//  what was asked for, and the fix is to know, per field, what it costs.
