//  MetadataField.swift
//  MediaMetadata
//
//  Created by David Sherlock on 2026.
//
//  The catalogue of everything this package can answer about a file.
//
//  One flat list rather than a type per media kind, because the caller's
//  question is flat: a folder holds photographs beside invoices beside
//  recordings, and the answer is one table with a column per field and an
//  empty cell where a field does not apply. A file is never asked whether it
//  "is an image" — it is asked for `camera`, and says nothing if it has none.
