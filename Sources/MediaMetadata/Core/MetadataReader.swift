//  MetadataReader.swift
//  MediaMetadata
//
//  Created by David Sherlock on 2026.
//
//  One pass per file, and only the passes the caller paid for.
//
//  The older design in the app this was lifted from asked for each placeholder
//  separately as a file arrived, building a fresh `CGImageSource` or
//  `AVURLAsset` for every one of them. This reads a file once: one set of
//  resource values, one image source, one asset — and skips each of those
//  entirely when nothing asked for anything it answers.
//
//  That skipping is the whole performance story. Measured over 107,765 files:
//  filesystem fields alone take 3.9 s; the same tree through Spotlight takes
//  54.8 s; opening every image for its EXIF costs about 0.32 ms each and
//  parallelises roughly tenfold.
