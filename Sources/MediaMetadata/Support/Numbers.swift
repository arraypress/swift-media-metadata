//  Reading a number out of a Core Foundation dictionary without caring which
//  numeric type the format happened to use.
//
//  This exists because of a bug the tests caught. EXIF stores focal length as
//  a RATIONAL and focal-length-in-35mm as a SHORT, so ImageIO hands back a
//  `Double` for one and an `Int` for the other — and `value as? Double` on an
//  `Int` is `nil`, silently. Every numeric tag has the same exposure: a camera
//  writing ISO as a short and another writing it as a rational would disagree
//  about whether the column has any data in it.
