/// algorithms. This only maps fields onto it.

/// Worth knowing before adding one of these columns to a large folder: hashing
/// is bounded by the disk, not the processor. SHA-256 measures at roughly
/// 1 GB/s on one core and nearly 10 GB/s across them, so a warm local folder
/// is free and half a terabyte on a USB drive is forty minutes whatever the
